# Description

Selected tasks from Marijn Haverbeke "Eloquent JavaScript" 3rd ed.

The tasks will be solved at a whim, it is possible that I will modify some of them.
For better visual clarity I will not use quotations.

Probably I will be solving the tasks in TypeScript.

# Settings

Probably to solve a task I will use the following commands/settings.

## Project initialization

```bash
deno init my_project
```

# Coding and Running code

```bash
deno run --watch main.ts
```

or

```bash
deno task dev
```
