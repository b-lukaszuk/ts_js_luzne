## Title

Chessboard

## Description

Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8Ã—8 grid [...] At each position of the grid there is either a space or a "#" character. The characters should form a chessboard.

[...] should show something like this:

<pre>
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
</pre>

When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a binding size = 8 and change the program so that it works for any size, outputting a grid of the given width and height.
