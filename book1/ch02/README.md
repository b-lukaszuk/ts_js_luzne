# Description

Selected tasks from Marijn Haverbeke "Eloquent JavaScript" 3rd ed.

The tasks will be solved at a whim, it is possible that I will modify some of them.
For better visual clarity I will not use quotations.

Probably I will be solving the tasks in TypeScript.

# Chapter 2. Program structure.

## Chessboard

Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8×8 grid [...] At each
position of the grid there is either a space or a "#" character. The characters
should form a chessboard.

[...] should show something like this:

<pre>
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
</pre>

When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a binding size = 8
and change the program so that it works for any size, outputting a grid of the
given width and height.

# Settings

Probably to solve a task I will use the following commands/settings.

## Project initialization

```bash
deno init my_project
```

# Coding and Running code

```bash
deno run --watch main.ts
```

or

```bash
deno task dev
```
