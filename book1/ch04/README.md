## Title

A list

## Description

[...] A list is a nested set of objects, with the first object holding a reference to the second, the second to the third, and so on.

<pre>
let list = {
  value: 1,
  rest: {
    value: 2,
    rest: {
      value: 3,
      rest: null,
    },
  },
};
</pre>

Write a function `arrayToList` that builds up a list structure like the one shown when given `[1, 2, 3]` as argument. Also write a `listToArray ` [...]. Then add a helper function `prepend`, [...] and `nth`, which takes a list and a number and returns the element at the given position in the list (with zero referring to the first element) or undefined when there is no such element.

If you havenâ€™t already, also write a recursive version of `nth`.

## Title

Deep comparison

## Description

[...]

Write a function `deepEqual` that takes two values and returns `true` only if they are the same value or are objects with the same properties, where the values of the properties are equal when compared with a recursive call to `deepEqual`.

[..] But you have to take one silly exception into account: because of a historical accident, typeof null also produces "object". [...]
