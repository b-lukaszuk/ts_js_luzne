# Description

Selected tasks from Marijn Haverbeke "Eloquent JavaScript" 3rd ed.

The tasks will be solved at a whim, it is possible that I will modify some of
them. For better visual clarity I will not use quotations.

Probably I will be solving the tasks in TypeScript.

# Chapter 3. Functions.

## Bean counting

Write a function `countBs` that takes a string as its only argument and returns
a number that indicates how many uppercase “B” characters there are in the
string.

Next, write a function called `countChar` that behaves like `countBs`, except it
takes a second argument that indicates the character that is to be counted
(rather than counting only uppercase “B” characters). Rewrite `countBs` to make
use of this new function.

# Settings

Probably to solve a task I will use the following commands/settings.

## Project initialization

```bash
deno init my_project
```

# Coding and Running code

```bash
deno run --watch main.ts
```

or

```bash
deno task dev
```
