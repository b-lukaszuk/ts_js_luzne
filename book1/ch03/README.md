## Title

Bean counting

## Description

Write a function `countBs` that takes a string as its only argument and returns a number that indicates how many uppercase “B” characters there are in the string.

Next, write a function called `countChar` that behaves like `countBs`, except it takes a second argument that indicates the character that is to be counted (rather than counting only uppercase “B” characters). Rewrite `countBs` to make use of this new function.
