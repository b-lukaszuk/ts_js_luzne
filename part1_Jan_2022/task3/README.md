[Proper Divisors](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Proper_divisors)

## Description

### Basic Info

The `proper divisors` of a positive integer `N` are those numbers, other than `N` itself, that divide `N` without remainder.

For `N > 1` they will always include 1, but for `N == 1` there are no proper divisors.

### Examples

The proper divisors of 6 are 1, 2, and 3.
The proper divisors of 100 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, and 50.


### What to do?

Create a routine to generate all the proper divisors of a number.
use it to show the proper divisors of the numbers 1 to 10 inclusive.
Find a number in the range 1 to 20,000 with the most proper divisors. Show the number and just the count of how many proper divisors it has.

### Additional info

Interesting, this TS/JS program takes ~2.35 sec to execute, analogical program written in Python takes ~9.35 sec to execute (the same device, similar code)
