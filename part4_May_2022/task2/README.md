# Task 2

Write a program (function) that will take a molecular formula and compute the molecular mass [g/mol] of a substance.

Examples:

+ glucose
  - IN: "C6H12O6"
  - OUT: 180.156
+ phosphoric acid
  - IN: "H3PO4"
  - OUT: 98.00
+ tyrosine
  - IN: "C9H11NO3"
  - OUT: 181.191

## Task 2.1

Try to expand it to compute something a bit more difficult, like:

+ hydroxyapatite
  - IN: "Ca5(PO4)3OH" or "Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2"
  - OUT: 502.31 or 1004.62
