Write [Anagrams](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Anagrams)

## Description

When two or more words are composed of the same characters, but in a different order, they are called [anagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anagram).

Using the word list at http://wiki.puzzlers.org/pub/wordlists/unixdict.txt,
find the sets of words that share the same characters that contain the most words in them.

## Additional info

It takes around 0.06 sec to execute (on my laptop).
